the basic idea is to send a form package that can be supported and rendered by anything

a distributed form implementation that:
 . provides csrf tokens for server validations of origin
 . basic input validations that are consumed by the client as part of the form 
 . form markup that supports component renderings
 . submit handlers that are client agnostics . 
  .es5 handler for each change  element handler and submit...

so how does that look?
  . open->query->form w/handler js
  . basic hooks implemented on action->render?->reveal->instantiate handlers...

what do the hooks look like?
